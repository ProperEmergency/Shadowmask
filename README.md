# Shadowmask - Alpha Release
Shadowmask is a free wallpaper customization tool. 

This tool is currently in its alpha release, so it is a bit feature-sparse and can be prone to odd bugs. This started out as a fun side project, so there is definetly some polishing to be done.

Currently, you can use it to display images (PNG,JPG,GIFs), as well as websites, as your desktop background. The application supports multiple monitors, and because it is based on the same technology powering web browsers, pretty much any resolution.

Support will soon be added for video files as well as YouTube videos (limited support is already available via the webpage option... if you know how to format the url).

## Downloads

The MSI can be downloaded [here](../master/Binaries/Windows/Shadowmask%20Setup.msi?raw=true).

The software installs to Program Files, and data is stored in the Roaming AppData directory.

## Issues

This is new software, and the only way it can get better is with your feedback! Feel free to open up an [issue](https://github.com/ProperEmergency/Shadowmask/issues) if you notice any problems.

## Donations

First, let me re-emphasize - this software is *free*. I built it for fun, and to avoid paying for third-party software.

But if you like me so much that you still want to give me money, you can donate through patreon:
